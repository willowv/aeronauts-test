Player Airships:
x Still need to account for components being down
xx Make sure defenses are penalized when defense components are down
-- Make sure AI doesn't use disabled weapons
-- Make sure hits don't double up on disabled weapons

Combatant AI:
Needs to observe the entire game state
- Map/locations of all combatants
- Health and token status of each combatant
- Logic which takes in this information and executes an action
- Unique to a particular type of enemy, but re-usable so that there can be more than one

Actions
- Trigger free attacks
- Collect tokens based on self and target, if there is one
- Make a roll, generating initial impact
- Get possible hit locations and choose (always choose the component with the lowest health for now, otherwise a defensive component)
- Divide impact between targets
- For each target, adjust impact based on that target's tokens
- Based on impact, determine effects for that action
- Make a few basic actions that anyone can access from their AI logic

Set-update
- Support building an encounter with airships

Maps
- Support for maps/movement (abstract this somehow for now)
