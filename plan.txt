Incremental steps toward a full simulator

- Use real, seeded rolls with focus, tokens, and health/damage (but only use damage for now)
-- create a player class for tracking player health, ability scores, tokens, and focus
-- add tokens to enemy class
-- update simulator logic to deal damage to players instead of simply recording action count
-- update simulator logic to have players roll for damage instead of simply deducting action count

- Support airship combat
- Support for weapons/special actions with limited AI (healing/shielding vs. attacking)
