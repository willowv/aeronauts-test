Incremental steps toward a full simulator

- Use real, seeded rolls with focus, tokens, and health/damage (but only use damage for now)
-- create a player class for tracking player health, ability scores, tokens, and focus (x)
-- add tokens to enemy class (x)
-- add support for having players make attack/defense checks (x)
-- tests!
-- update simulator to run multiple times and output statistics
--- did players win; players average health/focus, lowest health/focus; unspent tokens of each type

- Support for weapons/special actions with limited AI (healing/shielding vs. attacking)
- Support airship combat
- Support for maps/movement (abstract this somehow for now)
